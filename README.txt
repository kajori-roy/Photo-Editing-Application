The primary objectives of the Mini-Photoshop project were to:
1. Implement Core Image Manipulation Operations: To create a
functional application capable of performing essential image editing
tasks such as opening image files, converting images to grayscale, applying
ordered dithering, auto leveling images, and calculating Huffman
encoding.
2. Develop a User-Friendly GUI: To design and implement an intuitive
graphical user interface that allows users to easily navigate and
utilize the application’s features.
3. Incorporate Advanced Image Processing Features: Beyond the
core requirements, to enhance the application’s capabilities by adding
optional advanced features like sharpness adjustment, blur effect, image
rotation, hue and saturation adjustment, and the ability to save edited
images.
